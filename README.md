# graduation-project-Disaster-recovery
Build proposed disaster recovery solution for the data center in khan  Younis municipality via Microsoft azure cloud computing infrastructure(Microsoft azure)

## Abstract

The main goal of our project is to facilitate the process of disaster recovery and maintain a 
reduction in the proportion of financial losses and data loss in the event of a disaster and prepare 
the municipality in the event of natural disasters, wars, technical or human errors through prior 
planning for the method of disaster recovery and dealing with it with the least losses and as quickly 
as possible.
Through our project, we studied the municipality’s situation and anticipated the worst possible 
scenarios. We worked on creating the first disaster recovery plan in the municipality to help them 
recover step by step. We found improvement solutions to weaknesses. The municipality’s 
infrastructure helps the system recover quickly and with minimal data loss. We worked on finding 
solutions that target them. Reducing the time of business interruption in the municipality and 
implementing these solutions in an experimental environment, we chose cloud computing to 
implement this, and we applied a group of technology to the same infrastructure to achieve the 
goals of disaster recovery within the data center. Another center is in a geographical area far from 
the state. Data is transferred synchronously between the two sites and we used some technology 
to automatically transfer between the two sites and transfer services to the other site and provide 
services through it
In the future, we will be keen to increase the level of safety in the data center, develop a disaster 
recovery plan according to developments and updates in the municipality, and implement all 
practical aspects of the real environment of the project.
Within our project, there will be a time plan showing what has been achieved, developed, and 
followed up step by step.
Finally, the writing of the project report was completed and implemented in a practical way, 
thanks to God and the efforts of our supervisor, thanking him for his effort in following up and 
supervising our project.
